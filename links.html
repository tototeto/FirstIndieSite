					Youtube
				</h3>
				<p>
					I began my Youtube channel in the summer of 2016. It is a gaming channel with primarily Rocket League content. It is a fairly low quality channel, but hey, maybe someday I'll get famous, right?

				<h3>
					Twitch
				</h3>
				<p>
					My Twitch stream is not always active, but sometimes i'll stream a bunch for a few days. I almost always stream CS:GO with my friend August. Thats the most entertaining thing I can stream. I would stream Rocket League, but it lags my computer when I try.

					Steam
				</h3>
				<p>
					Feel free to add me on Steam! I'm always looking for people to play with, whether it's Rocket League, Rust, or some other game. (I also play Blizzard games, but I wont link that one. Too much work). Anyways, I play a whole bunch of games, and I'm happy to find new people.

				<h3>
					Other Sites
				</h3>
				<p>
					I have made a few other sites, although they aren't very good. I should warn you about them though, I was reeeeeally bored when I made these, so they get a bit... Satan-y. Just keep in mind, they are just jokes, I'm not actually a Satanist, and I was just trying to mess with my friends in the Web Design class I was taking.
