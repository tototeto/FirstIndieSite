					Rocket League

					Rocket League, the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars, is essentially car-soccer. In the Standard gamemode, two teams of 3 face off, each character controlling their own customizable car. While the cars are for the most part very similar, there are very minor differences between different cars that make it possible for each player to have the car that most suits them. There is one large ball in the center of the field, and each team has a goal to defend. The goal of the game is to score the most goals in the five minute game.
				</p>
				<p>
					While Rocket League can be difficult to learn starting out, it is still fun at all skill levels. Once you are able to master the basic controlls, however, the game's possibilities expand exponentially. The game has one of the highest skill caps of any game. The community is fairly mixed- you are likely to meet about as many jerks as good fun people. Don't let this ditur you, because once you meet one or two people, you can form a team and play together, making the game much more fun. The game does include microtransactions, but they are purely cosmentic, and grant no advantage. All in all, I may be biased, but this is my favorite game, and for the price I would strongly recommend it. Just make sure you play on PC with some kind of controller. Trust me.

					Super Smash Bros. Melee is a simple 2-D multiplayer game. The goal of the game is force the other players to fall out of the play area, using creative attack combos. The player roster includes characters from a multitude of Nintendo<sup>TM</sup> characters. Different characters have their own unique abilities and playstyles. Up to four players can play at once.
				</p>

					I will be honest, I'm not very good at Super Smash Bros., and consequently probably not the best source. However, I can say that personally I find the game very fun, and from what I see from the pro scene, it has a very high skill cap. I would recommend this game. (It is only available on the Gamecube, so if you dont have one, emulate it with dolphin ;p)

					Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

					Rating: 3.5/5
				</p>
				<p>
					In the standard competetive gamemode, Counter-Strike:Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 5v5 first-person-shooter game for the PC. One team, the Terrorists, are given a bomb to plant at one of several designated plant-sites. The other team, the Counter-Terrorists, have to prevent the Terrorists from planting the bomb, or diffuse it if it gets planted. If either team can kill all players on the other team before any of this happens, they win. The game continues for the best of 30 rounds. At the start of each round, each player buys weapons and gear with the money earned from the previous round.
				</p>
				<p>
					In theory, this game is not bad. Each team has an objective, weapons need to be earned, and communication is necessary. However, the community is toxic, and there are many mechanical issues with the game that make it fall behind its potential. In addition, the money system gives an additional advantage to the winning team, making comebacks unfairly difficult. Unless you have a friend to play with, I would not really recommend this game.
