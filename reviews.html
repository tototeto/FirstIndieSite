				Hi There,
			</h2>
			<p>
				Hey. So if you're seeing this, you're perobably someone who saw my snapchat story. I just started making this, and its 10:47 PM 7/15/2017.
				Im honestly just making this to see if I can. If I end up using any images, they're probably copyrighted, so yeah. Anyways, if this turns
				into Satanism like the last site, I promise it's just a joke.
			</p>
			<p>
				Im don't really have an objective with this site, so I think I'm going to have a page with all my related links, some random game reviews 
				for no reason, a random info page about my Rocket League team because why not, and then just an info page. Seriously, if you have any 
				suggestions, hit me up. If you don't have my info, my email is at the bottom
			</p>
