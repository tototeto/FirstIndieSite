				[RaZe]
			</h2>
			<p>
				RaZe is my Rocket League team. It was established some time in the summer of 2016, and as I am writing this, only consists of me and my friend Justin (for the people who go to my school, different Justin). We used to have more members, but we kind of lost them after that summer ended. In case you were wondering, yes, the name is a ripoff of FaZe. When I was coming up with the idea, I thought it would be funny because FaZe is full of trickshotters, so the idea was that we were going to be the trickshotters of Rocket League. And maybe get a sponsorship from Razer.... Anyways, thats RaZe.

				There is a Steam group for RaZe. It is pretty outdated however, so if you want to join, add me on Steam. My profile is on the Links page. If you do want to join, we're open to new members. As I'm writing this, we're roughly gold ranked in skill, so if you're way better than us, don't join.
